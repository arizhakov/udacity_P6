Create a data visualization from a data set that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in the data. Use either dimple.js or d3.js to create the visualization. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

## Summary 
"in no more than 4 sentences, briefly introduce your data visualization and add any context that can help readers understand it"

This data visualization tries to boil down a large data set into a chart that can be easily absorbed. 5 dimensions of data are shown in the chart: Fare, Age, Sex, Survived, and Family size. Although a bit noisy, there are insights about fare and age with respect to survival. The main purpose of this exercise was to fit as many dimensions onto a chart as possible - an explanatory finding of the larger concept of how data can be "flattened" from a complex table to a readable chart. 

For more information, please see Ref. 1 and 2 for more information. 

## Design 
"explain any design choices you made including changes to the visualization after collecting feedback"

## Feedback 
"include all feedback you received from others on your visualization from the first sketch to the final visualization"

## Resources 
"list any sources you consulted to create your visualization"
